# MecanicCalcApp

A simple over-engeenired app to for pre established calculation.

I made it to learn how to build for android and as a way to have fun with Unreal properties.
The project allows to define a class c++ and it will generated a widget to display the calculation for the users.
It's has I said : Over-engeenired. You probably don't need to go through all the trouble of interpreting class parameters. A simpler version with a custom paramter map would probably do the job as well.
But hey ! Over-engeeniring is fun !:D
